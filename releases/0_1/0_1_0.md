# Embeddr 0.1.0 (Comfy) — alpha

> Comfy - the original spark.

Embeddr 0.1.0 represent the first working prototype of Embeddr, built around ComfyUI workflows.

This release focused on making it possible to:
- Run and manage ComfyUI workflows from a custom client
- Upload and retrieve images and generations
- Manage basic 'artifact' metadata
- Experiment with UI panels and workflow runners

This version shipped with:
- a pre-baked ComfyUI integration
- example plugins
- a tightly coupled UI and backend

## What this release was for 

0.1.0 existed to validate a single idea:

Can a general tool orchestration layer sit on top of creative tools like ComfyUI and feel native?

It proved that:
- Workflows can be surfaced as interactive tools
- UI Panels can wrap and control external systems
- Remote execution and media retrieval can feel local


### Why 0.2.0 exists

As the prototype grew, several limitations became clear:
- ComfyUI was implicitly the center of the system
- Media and results were treated as tool outputs rather than first-class objects
- There was no unified way to model relationships, provenance, or reusable actions
- Transports (UI, API, LLM access) were tightly coupled to specific integrations

These constraints directly led to the redesign in Embeddr 0.2.0 (Archy), introducing:
- Artifacts as first-class entities
- A general relational graph
- Capability-based plugins
- Transport-agnostic access

#### Note

Embeddr 0.1.0 is preserved as a historical prototype.

New development continues in Embeddr 0.2.0 and later releases.
